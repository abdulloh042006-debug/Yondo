# WORKLOG — read this first, update it last
Newest entry first. Template at the bottom. Labels: PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED / NOT IMPLEMENTED / OUT OF SCOPE.

## Status snapshot
- Branch `design/prototype` (base `origin/codex/notification-integration`). Last commits: `dbc9113` (decisions D1–D5, audit) on top of `065741f` (remote). **Push of `dbc9113` and later: BLOCKED (no approved auth in the sandbox).** A verified `design-prototype.bundle` carries the commits.
- Backend: PostgreSQL 16 200/200 PASS (SQLite 192 + 8 skipped); migrations 14 up/down/up PASS; 50 real-backend decision tests PASS on both DBs.
- Prototype (mock-backed, NOT a real client): node 40/40, Chromium E2E 39/39, sweep 63 (+3) over 9 configs × 25 views, gallery 5/5.

## Next steps (priority order)
1. **Push** the branch once auth exists (`gh auth login` / credential manager / SSH / `GH_TOKEN` env). Verify remote SHA. Then read CI results for the branch (BLOCKED so far).
2. **Backend owner decisions needed:** delivery-fee configuration schema; profile→user id mapping (options A/B/C in `design-prototype/docs/03-decisions-and-contract.md`, unlocks customer-side report/block); CORS policy; whether to cap/stringify amounts > 2^53−1; apply `contract/openapi-v1.decisions.overlay.json` to the FastAPI models.
3. **Staging:** none documented. Obtain URL, test-login method (staging has no dev OTP; no SMS provider), payment sandbox, approved fee policy (`docs/04-staging-readiness.md`). Then add a read-only real-API contract check and an adapter that swaps the mock for the real client.
4. **Real clients:** `apps/mobile`/`apps/admin` are stubs. Build only if ROADMAP authorizes; reuse `design-prototype/design-system` and `prototype/src/logic.js`.
5. **Quality gaps:** native Uzbek copy review; real iOS Safari/Android, Firefox/WebKit and screen-reader testing; logo symbol outlining, kerning, similarity/legal check; merch + presentation (P1/P2) not started.
6. Housekeeping: decide on `ruff format` (50 files drift, not CI-enforced); keep screenshots/reports regenerated only when UI changes.

## Session log
### S9 — CLAUDE.md + WORKLOG (this entry's commit)
Done: created `CLAUDE.md` (credit-saving rules, commands, product rules, git/push policy, session protocol) and this worklog. Owner granted standing permission to push without asking (merge/force/deploy still need explicit instruction).
Not done: push (BLOCKED, no auth). Evidence: files exist; no secrets (scanned). Commit: see `git log -1 -- CLAUDE.md`.

### S8 — Decisions D1–D5 + backend audit (`dbc9113`)
Done: fee policy unconfigured by default (503), integer tiyin/BigInt money, availability containment (backend already did it), "Maxsus kunlar", user-id vs profile-id reports (prototype stopped sending profile ids), mock aligned with real backend, 50 real-backend tests, OpenAPI overlay (proposal only), staging readiness doc, audit report.
Not done: staging/real devices/CI/push (BLOCKED); delivery-fee schema & mapping (backend work).
Evidence: `design-prototype/reports/test-report.md`, `reports/backend-audit.md`.

### S7 — Backend decisions round 1 + push (`065741f`, pushed)
Done: report target = user id and cancellation/refund = undefined decisions applied to copy/docs; F7b test. Push succeeded once with a user-supplied token (token now compromised/revoked: never reuse).

### S6 — Iteration 5, component library, companion/vendor flows, 6 screens, real-browser tests (`f9a6331`)
Done: component library + gallery, companion and vendor flows to the contract, six standalone screens, Chromium harness (overflow, touch, clipping, measured contrast, occlusion, axe), 11 defects found/fixed, PostgreSQL 16 validation (200/200).
Key corrections found: payment only after `accepted`; gift+booking checkout always 503; backend error envelope is flat.

### S1–S5 — Audit, brand, tokens, first prototype, iterations 1–4
Done: repo audit; brand directions → logo (angled-Y, 4 themes); tokens + measured contrast; first prototype; iteration reports 1–4 and honest scoring (`design-prototype/reports/`).
